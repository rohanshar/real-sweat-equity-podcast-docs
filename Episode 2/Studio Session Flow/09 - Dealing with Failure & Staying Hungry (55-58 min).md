## Purpose
Understanding the drive for continuous improvement and relationship with failure

## Host Question (Hitesh):
"Itna sab kuch hone ke baad bhi, aap kehte hain ki still feel unfinished. Why?"

## Talking Points (Garima) + Answer Hints:
- **PBP LEL not finished in time**: "PBP aur LEL cutoff mein finish nahi kar paye the"
- **Failure fuels her**: "Failure mujhe fuel karti hai, motivate karti hai"
- **Wants joy not survival**: "Joy ke saath ride karna chahti hun, sirf survival mode mein nahi"
- **Desire to get better**: "Bas better hone ki drive hai constantly"

## Host Affirmation (Rohan):
"Aap medals se driven nahi hain—aap mastery se driven hain. Failure isn't the opposite of sweat equity—it's proof you're still investing. Aap still putting yourself on the line. Aapne hard part kar liya—now you want to do it with grace, with strength, with joy. Aur that's what keeps the engine running."

## Follow-up - The Dark Place & Mind Hacks

## Host Question (Rohan):
"Aur tough moments mein kya karte hain? Jab mind quit karna chahta hai?"

## Talking Points (Garima) + Answer Hints:
- **Counts backwards**: "Backwards counting karti hun"
- **Pep talks**: "Khud ko pep talks deti hun"
- **Pain management tricks**: "Pain manage karne ke tricks seekhe hain"
- **Mindset over matter**: "Mindset over matter ka belief hai"

## Host Affirmation (Hitesh):
"That's so real. Mujhe Gates of Heaven yaad hai—mujhe stretches ko chapters ki tarah count karna pada tha. The counting, the pep talks—yeh mental sweat equity hai. Aap apne mind mein invest kar rahe hain jaise body mein kiya tha. That mental strategy—it's not about conquering the pain, it's about dancing with it."

## Universal Application (Rohan):
"Yeh mental strategies—cycling ke alawa bhi kaam karti hain. Yeh life tools hain born from sweat equity."

## Notes from Garima Discovery:
- What keeps you going - failure teaches you more than other things
- Phase when didn't want to cycle - left cycling for 2-3 months
- The dark place - pep talk
