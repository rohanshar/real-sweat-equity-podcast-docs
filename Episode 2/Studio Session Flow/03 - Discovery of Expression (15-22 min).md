## Purpose
Explore the first pockets of freedom and authentic expression

## Host Question (Rohan):
"Din mein koi aisa part tha jo sirf aapka lagta tha? Even briefly?"

## Talking Points (Garima) + Answer Hints:
- **Weight training at home**: "Ghar mein weight training karti thi, bas wahi mera space tha"
- **Old friend/trainer as emotional outlet**: "Ek purana friend tha jo trainer tha, uske saath emotional outlet milta tha"
- **Felt emotionally alive there**: "Bas usi time emotionally alive feel karti thi, baaki jagah numb lagta tha"

## Follow-up Questions:
- "Yeh space baaki sab jagah se different kya tha?"
- "Yeh tha aapka first taste of authentic expression—kaisa feel hua tha?"

## Host Affirmation (Hitesh):
"Trainer ke saath woh space—sounds like aapki first breath of fresh air in a suffocating routine. Expression begins in small pockets of safety. Aur yahan beautiful irony hai—jo sweating se nafrat karti thi, uski first freedom mili... sweating ke through. That's the universe's sense of humor right there."

## Universal Connection (Rohan):
"Humare listeners jo trapped feel kar rahe hain—sometimes freedom starts in the smallest, most unexpected spaces. Aur phir aaya unexpected twist, right?"

## Notes from Garima Discovery:
- "I have never been into sports. Sports was about sweating. That I hated."
- But this space felt different - it was freedom

## Time Target: 7 minutes
