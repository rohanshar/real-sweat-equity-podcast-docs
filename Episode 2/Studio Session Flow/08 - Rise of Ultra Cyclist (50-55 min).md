## Purpose
Journey from personal transformation to community building

## Host Question (Rohan):
"Aur us ke baad—aapne sirf ride nahi kiya, aapne lead kiya. Batao about the journey from there to Paris-Brest-Paris, LEL, aur Cyclone building."

## Talking Points (Garima) + Answer Hints:
- **Completed PBP & LEL**: "PBP aur LEL complete kiye"
- **Didn't finish within time**: "Time mein finish nahi kar paye but kept riding"
- **Built Cyclone**: "Cyclone build kiya tha apna club"
- **Created support system**: "Support system banaya jo mujhe chahiye tha"
- **Karma circle**: "Help first ka philosophy—karma circle mein believe karti hun"

## Host Affirmation (Hitesh):
"Initial transformation ke baad bhi, aap investing karte rahe—PBP, LEL, building Cyclone. Your sweat equity journey didn't stop, it expanded. Aapne woh cheez create ki jo aapko once needed tha—a tribe. You created the support system you once needed—that's sweat equity coming full circle. A cycling club jo karma mein believe karti hai: help first, and help will come. It's not just miles, it's meaning."

## Universal Connection (Rohan):
"Aapki story shows karti hai ki real transformation doesn't end with personal change—it extends to lifting others."

## Notes from Garima Discovery:
- Social connection - help first
- Accountability through data and numbers

## Time Target: 5 minutes
