## Purpose
Understand when cycling became deeper than fitness

## Host Question (Hitesh):
"Kab realize hua ki yeh sirf fitness ke baare mein nahi hai—but something way deeper?"

## Talking Points (Garima) + Answer Hints:
- **Ride to India Gate**: "India Gate tak ride ki thi, pehli baar"
- **First time she felt joy, freedom**: "Pehli baar joy aur freedom feel kiya tha"
- **Realized she had been depressed**: "Tab realize hua ki main depressed thi itne time se"
- **Freedom helped understand past**: "Us freedom ne past ko samjhane mein help kiya"

## Follow-up Question:
- "India Gate wali ride—that was your moment of recognition. Kab realize kiya ki yeh just bike ride nahi hai?"

## Host Affirmation (Rohan):
"That's huge. Aapne sirf cycling barrier nahi toda—emotional denial ko toda. Sometimes we don't even know we're in pain… until we feel peace. Kitne log hain jo nahi jaante ki depressed hain until they feel joy for the first time?"

## Transition (Hitesh):
"Aur tab aapne start kiya investing your real sweat equity—not just physical, but emotional. Aap pour karna start kar diye yourself into this... But jab yeh mila, aapne ise hidden rakhne ka choice kiya, right?"

## Notes from Garima Discovery:
- Why cycling - it felt like freedom
- Depression phase recognition
- Identity crisis clarity

## Time Target: 7 minutes
