## Purpose
Dive into the magical day that started the cycling journey

## Host Question (Rohan):
"Us magical day ke baare mein bataiye—jo sabkuch start kar gaya."

## Talking Points (Garima) + Answer Hints:
- **Buddhist scroll installed at home**: "Ghar mein Buddhist scroll lagwaya tha"
- **Next day, went to Decathlon**: "Next day Decathlon gaye the randomly"
- **Bought a cycle without planning**: "Bina koi plan ke cycle kharid li, pata nahi kya hua"
- **Started cycling around the block**: "Ghar ke paas cycling karna start kiya"

## Follow-up Questions:
- "Kya lagta hai Buddhist scroll ne aap mein kuch open kar diya jo cycling ke liye ready kar gaya?"
- "Looking back, yeh timing coincidence se zyada feel karti hai?"
- "Decathlon mein bina plan ke gaye the cycle kharidne—woh moment kaisa tha?"
- "Khud ko question kiya ya bas right feel hua?"

## Host Affirmation (Hitesh):
"Yeh almost poetic hai—universe ne aap mein kuch open kar diya, aur next thing you know, you're riding. No agenda, just instinct. This is pure Real Sweat Equity—transformation ne aapko find kiya, not the other way around. Aur that instinct took you from local loops to something so much bigger."

## Notes from Garima Discovery:
- Spiritual angle - Ganesh installed and cycle came
- Why cycling - it felt like freedom
- First ride experience
- Kept it private initially - it was rebellious

## Time Target: 8 minutes
