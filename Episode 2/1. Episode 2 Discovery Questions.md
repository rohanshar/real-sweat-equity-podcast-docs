The Real Sweat Equity – Getting to Know Your Story

Hi Garry,

We’re super excited to have you on The Real Sweat Equity podcast—thank you for agreeing to share your story.

Ahead of our recording, we’ll have a short discovery chat in a couple of days just to align and plan how the episode can best flow. It’ll be conversational, but it helps if you can reflect on the following broad themes so we can bring out your story in the most authentic and impactful way.

No need to prepare scripts—just take a little time to think these through.

⸻

🔦 1. A Struggle or Tough Phase in Life
	•	Was there a time when life felt especially hard—mentally, emotionally, or physically?
	•	Any moment or experience that felt like a personal low or breaking point?

💭 2. Realization & Turning Point
	•	What made you realize that something had to change?
	•	Was there a specific moment or event that triggered the shift?
	•	Did you find clarity through any conversation, book, or reflection?

🏃 3. Your “Real Sweat Equity” Journey
	•	What steps did you take to invest in yourself—mentally, emotionally, physically, or spiritually?
	•	Did you start a practice like cycling, running, working out, meditation, journaling, or anything else?
	•	What kept you going when it got tough?

🤝 4. Support System & Inner Drive
	•	Were there people who supported you—friends, family, mentors?
	•	How did your own mindset evolve during this journey?

🌅 5. Where You Stand Today
	•	How have you changed since then—inside and out?
	•	What are you still working on today?
	•	What do you look forward to now from this journey or lifestyle?

🎯 6. What Listeners Can Take Away
	•	If someone listening is going through what you went through, what would you want them to know?
	•	What’s one small habit, practice, or mindset you’d recommend to anyone starting out?

Now a few more specific questions. Just give them a thought. Everything won't make it to the final shoot so focus on the ones that really resonate with you and will make for a good story. 

1. Every ultra-cyclist talks about hitting ‘the dark place’—that moment when your body is screaming to quit, sleep is a rumor, and doubt is louder than your heartbeat. Can you pull us into that exact moment and share the specific self-talk, breathing tricks, or mental frameworks you lean on to keep the pedals turning—and how someone listening at home could borrow the same mindset when their life gets rough?”

2. We often see the epic mileage and finish-line photos, but the real engine of ultra-cycling is built off the bike. What non-negotiable recovery or lifestyle rituals—whether that’s a strict sleep window, ‘real-food’ fueling, mobility work, or mindfulness practice—keep you healthy enough to chase those extremes? And for someone listening who just wants to wake up feeling better tomorrow, which single off-bike habit would you have them adopt first, and why?

3. Endurance gains come from showing up—day after day—not from one epic session. What everyday micro-community keeps you accountable? Maybe it’s the 5 a.m. ride text that says ‘Rolling?’ or a friendly Strava nudge when you skip. Could you unpack exactly how that steady drip of peer pressure and support gets you out the door? And for someone listening right now who trains solo, what’s one do-it-today step—like posting a weekly ride invite or joining a local WhatsApp group—that will create the same daily accountability in their own life?

4. Your biggest gains come from simply showing up—ride after ride—but the nudge that gets you out the door often comes from your circle. Can you share how that _everyday micro-community_—a 5 a.m. ‘Rolling?’ text, a playful Strava rivalry, or a buddy waiting at the café—creates consistency _and_ teaches broader life lessons about commitment and mutual support?> Then, for someone listening who isn’t even training yet but craves that kind of lift in work, relationships, or personal goals, what’s one _life-wide_ action they can take today to start building a support network that keeps them moving forward—on the bike or off?

5. Picture a listener who’s completely stalled—maybe in fitness, work, or just getting through the day. If you could hand them one concrete action to take in the next 24 hours to spark momentum on their own ‘sweat-equity’ journey, what would it be, and what change should they feel once they’ve done it?

Feel free to jot a few points if that helps—but most importantly, just reflect. We’re not here to interrogate; we’re here to listen, learn, and celebrate real sweat equity.

Looking forward to catching up for the discovery chat!

Warmly,
The Real Sweat Equity Team
